# Voice Classification

This repository contains code for two methods of speaker classification using machine learning.

## Usage

This repository contains code for splitting an audio file into 1-second-long chunks, and then two examples of using that data to perform speaker recognition. Those speaker recognition examples will allow you to provide a new piece of audio data and classify which speaker is talking in the example.
